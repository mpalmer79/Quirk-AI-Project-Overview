    <h1>Authorization to Obtain Consumer Report (FCRA)</h1>
    <p>
      By submitting a credit application, you authorize <strong>[Dealership Name]</strong>, its affiliates,
      and financing sources (including banks, credit unions, RouteOne and CUDL network lenders) to obtain your
      consumer report and other information from consumer reporting agencies for the purpose of evaluating your
      creditworthiness in connection with this application and any update, renewal, or extension of credit.
      This may involve a <strong>credit inquiry</strong> that can impact your credit score.
    </p>

      You certify that the information provided is true and correct. If applying with a co-applicant, you have
      their permission to provide their information and they similarly authorize these inquiries.
